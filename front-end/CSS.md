# USAGE

### :first-child
> The :first-child pseudo class means "if this element is the first child of its parent". :last-child means "if this element is the last child of its parent". Note that only element nodes (HTML tags) count, these pseudo-classes ignore text nodes.


# Performance

### box-shadow transition
Set the box-shadow to element's pseudo element and use 'opacity' in transitions to get a better performance.
